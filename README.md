# Etch-A-Sketch
Etch-A-Sketch webpage created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Some notes about the behavior of the controls:

    - Changing grid size will erase the grid
    - Shading Mode will override rainbow squares, but not black squares
    - Rainbow Mode, Normal Mode, and Eraser mode will override any square

Have fun sketching!
